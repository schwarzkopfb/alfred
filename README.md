Some of my Alfred.app custom workflows

## pj
Parse and explore JSON data from clipboard without leaving Alfred

![demo](./img/pj2.gif)

### How does it work?

* Type `pr [property path]` and hit enter to list keys from JSON data currently copeied into clipboard. Just skip path to list the root level properties. Path is the standard JavaScript accessor syntax and is processed with [lodash.get](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.get).
* Arrays and Objects will be further expanded, primitive values can be copied back to the clipboard directly.
* Hold Cmd âŒ˜ to copy the property path insted of the value.

### Requirements
* [zx](https://github.com/google/zx) installed [with homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/zx)
